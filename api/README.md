This is the API for the Cosmic Code Showcase portfolio, built with NestJS. It is responsible for serving certain data required by the frontend.

## Installation

## Note on nestjs-github-activity package

The `nestjs-github-activity` package is sourced from GitHub.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/mlnbk/nestjs-github-activity).

After cloning the repository, it needs to be built using `npm run build`.

Once built, it can be locally linked to your project using `npm link` in the source app.

Then, navigate to the `api` directory of the this application where you want to use this package. Run `npm link nestjs-github-activity`.

This will create a symbolic link from the local `node_modules` folder to the global package.
