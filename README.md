# Personal Portfolio - A Cosmic Code Showcase ðŸš€ðŸŒŒðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my coding universe-themed portfolio, powered by React. The project showcases my software engineering journey and the projects I've created across various galaxies of interest.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **API**: This is the backend of the application, built with NestJS. It is responsible for serving the data required by the frontend. You can find more details in the [api/README.md](api/README.md).

2. **Web**: This is the frontend of the application, built with React and Tailwind CSS. It is responsible for displaying the data served by the API in a user-friendly manner. You can find more details in the [web/README.md](web/README.md).

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `api` directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the backend.
3. In the `api` directory, run `npm run start:dev` to start the backend server.
4. Navigate to the `web` directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.
5. In the `web` directory, run `npm run start` to start the frontend server.

Now, you should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
